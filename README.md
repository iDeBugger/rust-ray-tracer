This is a project I written to try implement ray tracer by my own.

# Scene

Scene contains four spheres with different properties (one of them is quite big and used as floor for others). 

# Abilities

For now this ray tracer can:

- Simulate three kinds of light: ambient, directional and point
- Trace shadows
- Trace specular and diffusion reflection on sphere surface
- Trace real reflection with an arbitrary depth
